Welcome to my data structures repository! 

I regularly solve various leetcode coding problems in python, focusing on different data structures. 
The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills, learn and practice various algorithms.

My roadmap:

1. Arrays & Hashing
2. Two Pointers
3. Stack
4. Binary Search
5. Sliding Window
6. Linked List
7. Trees
8. Tries
9. Backtracking
10. Heap / Priority Queue
11. Graphs
12. 1-D Dynamic Programming
13. Intervals
14. Greedy
15. Advanced Graphs
16. 2-D Dynamic Programming
17. Bit Manipulation
18. Math and Geometry
